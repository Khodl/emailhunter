# emailhunter API wrapper
Use http://emailhunter.co with NodeJS

## Initialisation

First, call the library:

	var EmailHunter = require('emailhunter');

Then create a new instance with your API key

	var em = new EmailHunter("YOUR API KEY");

You can also use that directly in one line

	var em = require('emailhunter')("YOUR API KEY");

## Domain search

Get the list of all the emails from a given domain name.
Each email is returned with the source(s), its type (generic or personal) and the date it was extracted on.

	em.search('stripe.com',function(err,emails){

		if(err) return console.error('ERROR',err);

		console.log("EMAILS FOUND:",emails);

	});

## Email check

Find if a given email exist. If it does, return where it was found. If not, an empty array is returned

	em.exist('paralegal@stripe.com',function(err,sources){

	    if(err)
	        return console.error('ERROR',err);

	    console.log("Sources about the email");
	    console.log(sources);

	});
